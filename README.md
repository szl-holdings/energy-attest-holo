# energy-attest-holo

**Honest, holographic energy-attestation surface for the SZL Holdings sovereign mesh.**

Static, self-contained HTML page (0 runtime CDN) that reports the estate's **energy
attestation** posture and never fabricates a joule. Current meter state is requested at view
time. When no fresh NVML evidence is reported, energy remains **UNAVAILABLE in RED**.

- **Live Space:** https://huggingface.co/spaces/SZLHOLDINGS/energy-attest-holo
- **Status:** the static page is published; meter availability is a separate runtime dependency
  and is relayed as **REPORTED** from a11oy at observation time.

## What it shows

| Panel | Source (keyless, client-side) | Label |
|---|---|---|
| Sovereign mesh energy meters | a11oy [`/govern/health`](https://szlholdings-a11oy.hf.space/api/a11oy/v1/govern/health) — per-engine `LIVE`/`DOWN`, per-meter NVML reachability, `engines_live/total` | **REPORTED** (a11oy self-report); only API transport is **MEASURED** by this browser |
| GB grid carbon intensity | [National Grid ESO Carbon Intensity API](https://carbonintensity.org.uk) `/intensity` | **REPORTED** (grid context, not our own compute) |
| GB generation mix | Carbon Intensity API `/generation` | **REPORTED** |

## Honesty doctrine (binding)

- **MEASURED** = this browser saw the real HTTP result · **REPORTED** = upstream self-report
  pass-through · **UNAVAILABLE** = source unreachable / capability honestly absent — never fabricated.
- **Energy is null unless a real NVML meter reports.** No invented joules.
- **Λ = Conjecture 1** — advisory, never proven, trust ceiling 0.97, never green.
- **0 runtime CDN** — no external libraries, no web fonts; a single vanilla-JS 2D canvas
  draws the holographic lattice.

## Deploy
